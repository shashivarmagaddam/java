## üñ•Ô∏è How to Compile and Run Java Programs

### **1. Prerequisites**

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):**  
  Make sure you have [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed (version 8+ recommended).

- **Command Line/Terminal** (Windows, Mac, Linux).

### **2. Compiling a Java File**

Open your terminal and navigate to the repository's source directory:

```bash
cd src
javac ProgramName.java
```

- This will generate a `ProgramName.class` file in the same directory (or `bin` if specified).

### **3. Running a Java Program**

After compiling, run the program with:

```bash
java ProgramName
```

- If your `.class` file is in `bin`, use:
  ```bash
  java -cp bin ProgramName
  ```

### **4. Example**

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
